===================
briefcase is a tool to facilitate keeping dotfiles in git, including those with private information (such as .gitconfig).
By keeping your configuration files in a git public git repository, you can share your settings with others. Any secret information is kept in a single file outside the repository (itâ€™s up to you to backup and transport this file).
